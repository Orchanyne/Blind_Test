# Blind-Test
Musical blind-test made as a semestrial project at the IUT DIJON 

The site uses socket.io to create the player rooms, the blind test list is updated by itself when we put a new folder with a picture and some songs. There is also a level system linked to a database, which is of course also used for player accounts. As you can see when you access the website, it uses cookies.
